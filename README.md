# Phrase_hunter__game_OOP
 
This game was done for a Treehouse Techdegree project and is to be completly terminal/console based. 

Users will need to guess all the letters from a hidden randomly selected phrase and can only make 5 incorrect guesses before they lose.
The phrases are pulled from some of my favorite movies.

The phrase they are to guess is displayed as _ and users are prompted to guess letters. 
The display is updated as correct letters are guessed, changing the underscore to the letter, but if the guess is incorrect the number missed increases by one. 
The user wins if all letters are guessed correctly and loses if they make 5 incorrect guesses, with the correct verbiage being displayed. 

If the user guesses a letter already in the phrase, enters an empty space, or inputs an incorrect character this does not count against them, but they do receive prompts directing them how to correct thier mistake. 

Once the user has won or lost the game they receive a prompt asking if they would like to play again. If yes, the game restarts and resets the counters. If no, the game is ended with a polite sendoff. 

Enjoy!
